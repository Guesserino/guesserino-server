Built for the Pusher Hackday (August 2016)

## What is this hack about?

A game that plays a song and lets player guess what song it was. However, only a certain section of the song is player. For simplicity, again, the songs are manually curated and the most memorable 15s of a song is chosen. Players can see results in real time using Pusher!
